## This microservice is designed to be run on AWS infrastructure, specifically using ECS Fargate, Service Discovery, and a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.

This is a basic Spring Boot microservice created to test AWS infrastructure with services like ECS Fargate, Service Discovery with service connect, and CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins. This project is a good starting point for learning how to work with Spring Boot microservices in AWS.

## CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins

This microservice is built and deployed using a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins. Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server that can be used to automate various stages of the software delivery process. The pipeline includes stages for building, testing, and deploying the microservice.

## Pipeline Overview

This pipeline includes the following stages:

 * **Checkout**: This stage checks out the code from the Git repository.
 * **Build**: This stage builds the Spring Boot microservice using Gradle.
 * **Test**: This stage runs automated tests on the microservice.
 * **Dockerize**: This stage creates Docker images for the microservice with custom version tag and latest tag.(technique for preventing tags overwrite)
 * **Push to ECR**: This stage pushes the Docker images to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
 * **Update ECS Service**: This stage updates the ECS service with a new deployment to the latest version of the Docker image.
 
## Environment Variables

The pipeline uses the following environment variables:

 * **IMAGE_TAG**: The version tag for the Docker image.
 * **ACCOUNT_ID**:The AWS account ID.
 * **REGION**: The AWS region where the ECR repository and ECS cluster are located.
 * **ECR_REPO_NAME**: The name of the ECR repository where the Docker image will be stored.
 * **CLUSTER_NAME**: The name of the ECS cluster where the microservice will be deployed.
 * **ECS_SERVICE_NAME**: The name of the ECS service where the microservice will be deployed.
 
## Jenkins Configuration

To use this pipeline, you must configure the following in Jenkins:

  * Configure AWS credentials for the Jenkins user with permission to access ECR and ECS services.
  * Create a Jenkins pipeline project and configure the Git repository with the Jenkinsfile.
  * Set the environment variables in the pipeline configuration to match your AWS environment.
  * Run the pipeline to build, test, and deploy the Spring Boot microservice to ECS Fargate with a new deployment.
